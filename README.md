# diffFx-pytorch

A PyTorch-based library for differentiable audio effects processing, enabling deep learning integration with professional audio processing algorithms.

## Overview

diffFx-pytorch provides a collection of differentiable audio effects processors that can be seamlessly integrated into neural network architectures. The library implements common audio processing algorithms with PyTorch, making them end-to-end differentiable while maintaining professional audio quality.


## Installation

```bash
pip install diffFx-pytorch
```

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from difffx.processors.dynamics import Compressor

# Create a compressor
compressor = Compressor(sample_rate=44100)

# Process audio with direct DSP parameters
output = compressor(input_audio, dsp_params={
    'threshold_db': -20.0,
    'ratio': 4.0,
    'knee_db': 6.0,
    'attack_ms': 5.0,
    'release_ms': 50.0,
    'makeup_db': 0.0
})
```

## Neural Network Integration

The library supports deep learning integration through normalized parameters:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from difffx.processors import MultiBandCompressor

# Create a neural network controller
class CompressorNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_params):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, num_params),
            nn.Sigmoid()  # Output in range [0,1]
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)

# Initialize processor and network
mb_comp = MultiBandCompressor(sample_rate=44100, num_bands=3)
num_params = mb_comp.count_num_parameters()
controller = CompressorNet(input_size=16, num_params=num_params)

# Process audio with predicted parameters
features = torch.randn(batch_size, 16)
norm_params = controller(features)
output = mb_comp(input_audio, norm_params=norm_params)
```
