[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-v0.0.2-orange?style=flat)](https://pypi.org/project/diffFx-pytorch/)



Note: Several excellent libraries already exist, such as [GRAFX](https://github.com/sh-lee97/grafx), [dasp-pytorch](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/dasp-pytorch), [NablAFx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11668), and [torchcomp](https://github.com/DiffAPF/torchcomp). Some of my code is inspired by these libraries, and I'm grateful to their developers for implementing several fundamental processors. My core extension will be developing human-interpretable effect processors, where the parameters of each processor can be easily understood by humans. 


## Overview

**DiffFx** provides a collection of differentiable audio effects processors that can be integrated into neural network architectures. Most implementations follow methods from books including [Audio Effects: Theory, Implementation and Application](https://www.routledge.com/Audio-Effects-Theory-Implementation-and-Application/Reiss-McPherson/p/book/9781466560284?srsltid=AfmBOoojCHLTDV-4Yhh6U56cVwTQl2isUgl1KdVKsGFtGVwH2eAQbFnQ) and  [DAFX - Digital Audio Effects (Second Edition)](https://www.dafx.de/DAFX_Book_Page_2nd_edition/index.html)


## Installation
```bash
pip install diffFx-pytorch
```

or 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ytsrt66589/diffFx-pytorch.git
cd diffFx-pytorch
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

You can control each processor using either ```dsp_params``` or ```nn_params```. ```dsp_params``` represents the exact DSP parameters used for each processor, while ```nn_params``` contains normalized parameters ranging from 0 to 1 that are internally mapped to the desired DSP parameters by each processor. ```dsp_params``` offers precise manual control over each processor, while ```nn_params``` provides learnable control for neural networks.

### Using DSP Params 
```python
import torch
from diffFx_pytorch.processors.dynamics import Compressor

# Create a compressor
compressor = Compressor(sample_rate=44100)

# Process audio with direct DSP parameters
output = compressor(input_audio, dsp_params={
    'threshold_db': -20.0,
    'ratio': 4.0,
    'knee_db': 6.0,
    'attack_ms': 5.0,
    'release_ms': 50.0,
    'makeup_db': 0.0
})
```

### Neural Network Integration

The library supports deep learning integration through normalized parameters:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from diffFx_pytorch.processors.dynamics import Compressor

# Create a neural network controller
class CompressorNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_params):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, num_params),
            nn.Sigmoid()  # Output in range [0,1]
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)

# Initialize processor and network
comp = Compressor(sample_rate=44100)
num_params = comp.count_num_parameters()
controller = CompressorNet(input_size=16, num_params=num_params)

# Process audio with predicted parameters
features = torch.randn(batch_size, 16)
norm_params = controller(features)
output = comp(input_audio, nn_params=norm_params)
```
